# Sample Image Gallery

This website was created using Bootstrap PHP and MySQL

The directory structure is designed to use with Docker but if not running docker, move all contents of src directory to the parent directory.
The database connection settings in database.php is also created for docker but again, if your not using docker, I've included the string variables you will need. 

Lastly, I've included the mysql db in the db directory you will need to import into phpmyadmin

I hope someone finds this useful :-)
